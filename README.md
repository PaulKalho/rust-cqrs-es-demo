This is the demo project for the IP.

To run the backend just cd into the folder and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

Make sure that your database is running.

Also make sure to provide the right DATABASE_URL via ENV variables, if the default does not fit.

Same for the frontend.

Just cd into the folder, and follow the instructions there.
